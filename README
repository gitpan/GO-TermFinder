GO-TermFinder version 0.21
==========================

This set of modules can be have been developed under the auspices of
the GMOD project (http://www.gmod.org/), which seeks to create
software that may be generically useful for Model Organism Databases (MODs).

WHAT DO THEY DO?

These modules provide an object oriented set of libraries for dealing
with files produced by the Gene Ontology project (GO -
http://www.geneontology.org/).  In particular, the GO::TermFinder
object allows a client program to provide a list of genes, from which
it will determine p-values for the annotation associated with that
list of genes.  It does this using the hypergeometric distribution.
In addition, a corrected p_value is calculated, to correct for
multiple hypothesis testing.  Two simple clients of these modules are
provided in the examples directory.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

First decompress the gzipped tarfile, e.g:

   tar zxvf GO-TermFinder-0.21.tar.gz

Then cd into the created directory, e.g.:

   cd GO-TermFinder-0.21

Then actually install it:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The make install step will require, on most unix systems, that the
command be run with root privileges, as by default it will install the
libraries in a location (usually something like ${PERL5LIB}), which
requires root privileges to write there.  If you want to install the
libraries in an alternative place, such as your home directory, do:

perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site INSTALLSITELIB=/home/your/private/dir

as the first step of the installation, where /home/your/private/dir is
obviously your target destination.  Note for the example scripts to
work you will have to add:

use lib "/home/your/private/dir"

before the other use statements.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, etc, please post them to the
gmod site at http://www.gmod.org/, or send email to

Note

The ontology files in the t/ directory are solely for the purposes of
running the test suite.  You should get the latest versions from the
Gene Ontology website for your own analyses.
