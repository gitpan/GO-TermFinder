Revision history for Perl extension GO-TermFinder.

0.3  Wed Nov 26 11:48:57 2003

	- GO::AnnotationProvider::AnnotationParser

	Extensive reworking of the code, such that it is now case
	insensitive, with certain caveats.  See the pod for that
	module for more details.

	- GO::TermFinder

	No longer considers the root node, or its child (the aspect)
	as hypotheses, as they are known a priori to have a p-value of
	1.

	- GO::Node

	Added lengthOfShortestPathToRoot and meanLengthOfPathsToRoot
	methods.

	- added in new tests for the AnnotationParser that make sure
	  that the behaviour with respect to case insensitivity is
	  correct.

0.23 Sat Nov  1 11:56:43 2003

	- GO::OntologyProvider::OntologyParser;

	Added in check that a given non-comment line can actually have
	a GOID extracted, which makes the error a more informative
	when such a line is encountered, due to an error in an
	ontology file.

0.22 Sun Oct 19 16:54:38 2003

	- GO::TermFinder

	Fix for test that could occasionally fail that relied on
        the sort order of the pValue array when two items had the
        same pvalue.  It now sorts such cases explicitly by goid,
        so the result should always be the same.

0.21 Thu Oct 16 19:00:14 2003

	- GO::TermFinder

	Fix for situation when a gene identifier wasn't recognized,
	but wasn't handled properly - thanks to Shuai Weng for bring
	it to my attention.

	Cleaned up the code that calculates the p-values to make it
	easier to write a test-suite, which will allow me to make
	other desired changes with more confidence.

	- tests

	Created tests for the GO::TermFinder module itself, that pass
	under both OSX and Solaris in my testing - this should make it
	much easier to modify in future with less concern for failing
	to notice new bugs.

	- examples

	Added a new example, that makes it easier to analyze multiple
	files of gene names.

	- suppressed some warnings that occured due to some undefs
	  being used.
	
	- fixed some documentation typos

0.2  Mon Apr 14 17:55:28 2003

	- added in code such that the findTerms() method will return
	  enough data for you to be able to work out which genes in
	  the list you provided were annotated to which GO nodes.

	- started some work on Annotation, AnnotatedGene, and
	  Reference objects.  Nothing is using them yet though.
	
	- added in over 100 tests(!).  Still lots more to do, but this
	  should help keep the code honest...

0.1  Fri Mar  7 13:51:32 2003

	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-n GO-TermFinder -X
