Revision history for Perl extension GO_modules.

0.1  Fri Mar  7 13:51:32 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
		-n GO_modules -X

0.2  Mon Apr 14 17:55:28 2003

	- added in code such that the findTerms() method will return
	  enough data for you to be able to work out which genes in
	  the list you provided were annotated to which GO nodes.

	- started some work on Annotation, AnnotatedGene, and
	  Reference objects.  Nothing is using them yet though.
	
	- added in over 100 tests(!).  Still lots more to do, but this
	  should help keep the code honest...
