!this is a fake file, merely for testing purposes to check that the
!annotation parser works correctly
!
!First three entitities that share an alias, which is therefore
!ambiguous, and should get a 1 from nameIsAmbiguous()

!Now put in some entries with the same database id, but with a
!different casing.  GOIDs have arbitrarily had their first digit upped
!by 1, compared to the previous 'genes' solely for testing

!Now have something that has two different casings of the same name -
!neither should be ambiguous, and as the name isn't used elsewhere, a
!different casing of the name also shouldn't be ambiguous.

!Now an example of things sharing a name, but with different casings.
!One of them has the same name twice, but with different casings.  All
!three versions of the name should be unambiguous, but any differently
!cased version of the name should be ambiguous.
